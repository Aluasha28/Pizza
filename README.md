# Pizza
program for ordering pizza on the website

There are many functions here. For example: order a pizza of a certain type and size, add a new type of pizza, search for your order using the order id, and so on. And 4 classes were created for this purpose: Main, MyApplication, IDB, DB:
Main> this is where the MyApplication's object is created and a method of the "MyApplication" class is called from there
IDB> interface of the class DB
DB> connecting to databases and different methods related to databases, such as getting the pizza name and price, etc.
MyApplication> all the main methods are stored here such as the console menu
